# Enthusiast

#### I would highly recommend not to use this script for new installations. Although some modifications were made, this script is still pretty old, not very secure, and does not have any tests, that's why please only update it if you have already installed it before.

[Enthusiast](https://github.com/angelasabas/enthusiast), but using PDO instead of the deprecated MySQL extension. Requires at least PHP 7.1.

## Upgrading

If you are using [this version](https://github.com/angelasabas/enthusiast) of Enthusiast:

1. **Back up all your current Enthusiast configurations, files, and databases first.**
2. Take note of your database information in all your `config.php` files.
3. Download [an archive of the public folder of this repository](https://gitlab.com/tfl-php-scripts/enthusiast/-/archive/master/enthusiast-master.zip?path=public). Extract the archive.
4. Replace your current `enthusiast/` files with the `public/enthusiast/` files from this repository.
5. In every fanlisting folder, as well as in the enthusiast and collective folder, paste the `config.sample.php` file. Edit your database information and listing ID variable accordingly, and save it as `config.php` to overwrite your old one.

That's it! Should you encounter any problems, please create an issue here, and I will try and solve it if I can.
