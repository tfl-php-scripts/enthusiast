=============================

Enthusiast is a tool for fanlisting owners to easily maintain their
fanlistings.

This script is made available for free download, use, and modification as long
as this readme and other notes found throughout the script remains intact and
a link back to http://scripts.indisguise.org/ is given. It is hoped that
the script will be useful, but does not guarantee that it will solve any
problem or is free from errors of any kind. Users of this script are forbidden
to sell or distribute the script in whole or in part or offer paid
installation of this script without written and explicit permission from me,
and users agree to hold me blameless from any liability directly or indirectly arising from the use of this script.

These terms may be subject to change at any time without prior notice and will
still hold true for any earlier versions of the script and for any user of
any version of the script.

The development of Enthusiast 2 has been stopped. Bug fixes and addons may
still be provided if necessary but there will be no new features for
Enthusiast 2. Thank you.



Notes governing the creation of modifications
---------------------------------------------
Users are free to modify their Enthusiast 2 installations ONLY FOR PERSONAL
USE. This means that NO distribution of the modified Enthusiast 2 is allowed
without explicit written permission from me. If distribution is desired,
all distributions must pass through the official Indisguise Scripts website
(http://scripts.indisguise.org), under the Modifications section, with credits
to the modification creator. Since development of Enthusiast 2 has stopped,
virtually any modification can be made public in this manner, save the creation
of a single admin interface for Enthusiast 2, as either Enthusiast 3 or
FanAdmin already fulfills those ends. Troubleshooting of modified
Enthusiast 2 installations fall solely under the creator of the modification.
